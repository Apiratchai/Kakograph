# Kakograph
Kakograph is a mobile-first, zero-knowledge note-taking app for writing immediately without structure. All notes are encrypted on-device using keys derived from a 12 word seed phrase, with data remaining fully local or self-hosted by the user. Write first, organize later, your data stays yours.
